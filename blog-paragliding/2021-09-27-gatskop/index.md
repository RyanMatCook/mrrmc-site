## Introduction

Gatskop is a festival held every year in Cape Town attracting pilots from all over the South Africa. The idea is to camp, paraglide and have a good time. There is a little bit of competitive flying involved, but nothing that affects any world rankings (it's actually just for fun). 

The name Gatskop when loosley translated to English means to kick ass and that's exactly what we did!

This year's festival was very well organised by the Glen Paragliding Club and the turnout was around 50 pilots (showing up at different times of the festival). It featured 3 days of flying, overnight camping with parties and awesome prizes!
