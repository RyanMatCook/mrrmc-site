## Barberton Nationals April 2021

### Introduction

The Barberton Nationals 2021... to go, or not to go. From January 2021 I was torn with the decision.

Competitive flying for someone at my level simply seemed out of my reach. I was sitting on around 25 hours of airtime and around 50 flights (which in paragliding terms is a spring chicken üê£).

It wasn't until I attended the Wilderness Festival in March 2021 where I met the (in?)famous Stef Juncker that I was convinced it was the right place for me... And oh my what a good decision!
